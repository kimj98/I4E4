**Problems with the general solar cell:** Due to the weight of the solar cell itself, installation and maintenance are not easy. 
**Objective:** Propose a foldable solar cell structure that is easy to install and maintain. 

**Solution:**
- Solar cell panel with a layered structure of cell, EVA, and glass.
- The solar cell panel is interconnected using fibers (carbon fiber, glass fiber).
- The fiber-connected ends of the solar cell panel are connected to a hanger-shaped structure.

**Characteristics of the configuration:**
1. Foldable solar power made by connecting multiple solar cells with glass or carbon fiber.
   - Includes a backsheet made of glass or carbon fiber.
2. Each solar cell has a layered structure of glass or carbon fiber -> adhesive (Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate, EVA) -> cell -> adhesive -> glass.
3. The foldable solar power has hanger (ring) structures connected or formed at both ends, which can be connected at two points.
   - Can be secured with cable ties or bolted (holes are formed).
4. A structure (like cable ties) to adjust the length for installation at the end.
5. Flexible structure in the backsheet (glass fiber + EVA) located between the fixed solar modules (alternating fixed and flexible structure).
6. Connecting solar cells at once using one or more wirings or connecting each solar cell individually.
7. Anti-Reflective Coating (ARC) configuration is also possible on the backsheet (performed on the outer, side, and inner surfaces of the glass).
8. A structure that allows solar cells to generate power on both sides – either by attaching additional solar cells on the back or by using double-sided power-generating solar cells.

**Summary of Invention:**
1. **Foldable Solar Cell:** A foldable solar cell module with a layered structure of Glass – EVA – Cell. The solar cell is wrapped with EVA, so the structure can be summarized as Glass – EVA – Cell – EVA – Glass Fiber (or Carbon Fiber). The EVA section can consist of one or more layers, and its thickness can be adjusted. The glass has a thickness of about 2T and can be replaced with transparent acrylic. Additionally, the cell can generate solar power on both sides. Wiring can be one or more.
2. **Foldable Solar:** A structure that connects the aforementioned foldable solar cell modules in series. The connection is made using glass fiber (or carbon fiber). It is implemented by joining in either a plane type or a line type. The roles of the glass/carbon fiber are as follows: [1. Physical connection, foldable functionality 2. Backsheet role (attached to the back of the solar cell module to protect the cell and module from various external environments) 3. Shock absorption]. The wiring establishes an electrical connection.

Advantages of the foldable solar structure:

No additional installation costs are needed since it doesn't include any separate structures.
It has a structure that allows wind to pass through.
It's a mini-cell module.
It can be installed on surfaces that have irregularities.
Foldable Solar Structures:
a. Single-line Array Method:
i. Multiple solar cells are lined up on a flexible base material.
ii. Wiring of cells connected in a line can be single or multiple.
iii. Using one or more wirings, solar cells can be connected all at once or each cell can be individually connected.
iv. Wiring can be connected in both series and parallel methods.

b. Multi-line Array Method:
i. It can extend the single-line array to form two or more lines of arrays.
ii. Arrays are based on two or more directions, and they can either be arranged parallel to these directions or can be perpendicular to each other.
iii. With a single power source, positive (+) and negative (-) poles can be used to connect all solar cells at once or connect each individually.

Installation Structure for Foldable Solar:
a. Single-line Array Installation Structure:
i. Adjustable Ring Type: There's an adjustable ring on both ends of the base that can be used for installation.
ii. Hole Type: Holes on the corners of the base where fasteners (screws, cable ties, etc.) can be inserted for installation.
iii. Back Adhesive Type: The back of the base has an adhesive that can be used for attachment and installation.

b. Multi-line Array Installation Structure:
i. Adjustable Ring Type
ii. Hole Type
iii. Back Adhesive Type
iv. Expansion Method: Holes on the side corners of the single or multi-line array solar modules allow for another single or multi-line solar module to be attached, allowing for expansion to a multi-line array system.

Dual-side Cell Placement:
a. Dual-side Placement: Two solar cells can be attached on both sides of the Glass Fiber or Carbon Fiber.
b. Using Dual-side Cells: Cells manufactured to function on both sides can be used, allowing for power generation from both the front and back.

Structural Devices for Length Adjustment during Foldable Solar Installation (Example):

A length adjustment device, similar to the principle of a cable tie (equipped with a handle that can be tightened), is necessary.

Utilization of the Pascal's Principle: (A principle where the pressure of a liquid is equally transmitted in all directions, enabling the lifting of heavy objects. Jacks typically consist of a cylinder filled with liquid and a piston. When the piston moves, the liquid's pressure increases, and this pressure is transferred to another piston, lifting the heavy object.) (More details needed).
Installation of the length adjustment handle of the foldable solar on one side of its surface. There are internal devices, like cable ties or screws, to adjust the length.
Types of handles include:
a. Handles that can only be operated vertically or horizontally.
b. Handles that can be operated by turning them 180°.
c. Handles that can be operated by turning them 360°.
Foldable Solar:
(1) Repetitive structure of fixation and flexibility:

The foldable solar's repetitive structure consists of fixed sections and flexible sections.
On the backsheet (made of glass fiber), solar cells are arranged in series at specific intervals. The sections with solar cells are called the fixed sections, and those without are the flexible sections.
The backsheet (glass fiber) is made of fiberglass and EVA. It contains wiring, typically copper wires wrapped in an insulator.
The spacing between solar cells is divided into spacing a and spacing b (a > b).
The direction of flexibility depends on the space between the cells. Spacing a flexes clockwise, and spacing b flexes counterclockwise.
(2) Layered structure:

The Anti-Reflective Coating (ARC) is used, especially on the top, side, and bottom surfaces of the glass. The glass concerning the solar cell uses the ARC not only on the outer surface but also on the inner or side surfaces.
Size:
a. Surface type: Backsheet ≥ Adhesive layer ≥ Glass ≥ Cell
b. Line type: Adhesive layer ≥ Glass ≥ Cell ≥ Backsheet
The backsheet (with a diffused reflection structure) ensures no interfering reflections from sunlight striking directly.
Concept of backsheet coating.
Light reflection structure beneath the cell that converts into power.
Application of Foldable Solar Cells (Examples):

When installing foldable solar panels on the roof: Support it by hanging structures on both ends and the top of the roof, covering the roof with solar panels. At this time, you should be able to support it using the protruding structure on top of the roof.
When installing on the water's surface: After setting up supports (two in front, two behind, total of 4), install diagonally across the supports. For diagonal installation of the foldable solar panels, the front and rear supports should be of different lengths.
On noise barriers by the road:
● Roof: Install foldable solar panels on the roof in a similar principle.
● Side: Wrap foldable solar panels around the surface of the noise barrier. When covering the noise barrier, use hanger-like structures to keep it attached.
For wind power generation: Install a base between wind turbines. Centered on the base, install foldable solar panels flat between the two wind turbines.
Installation on pillars: Install foldable solar panels by hanging them on hooks on the pillars.
Wall: Install foldable solar panels flat on the wall.
Apartment balconies: Use hanger structures to install foldable solar panels flat on the balcony.
Billboards: Install between the pillars supporting the billboards and any available space between the billboards. Use hanger structures to install foldable solar panels between the two pillars.
